# QRCodeScannerBase

Implementation of a QR Code scanner using Pygame, VideoCapture 0OpenCV, and ZBar. Targets Python 2.7, for Twisted integration, and to support building an EXE with Pyinstaller.

Thanks to the book "OpenCV Computer Vision with Python" for kickstarting this project, after SimpleCV failed to work with the camera. Also, thanks to the OpenCV docs on Otsuâ€™s Binarization.
